Today we will look into Bridge Design Pattern in java. When we have interface hierarchies in both interfaces as well as 
implementations, then bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the 
implementation details from the client programs.

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently

The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer Composition over inheritance.

Bridge design pattern can be used when both abstraction and implementation can have different hierarchies independently 
and we want to hide the implementation from the client application.
